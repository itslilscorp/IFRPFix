# <a name="top"></a>Imagine Fun Resource Pack Fixed

#### It's widely known by anyone that plays on Imagine Fun that the best way to experience the server is on 1.12. This is in part due to the fact that the resource packs on higher versions aren't as complete as the one on the original version. I've sought to try and bring the resource pack for the other versions since then up to speed with 1.12 while also fixing any issues 1.12 has along the way.

- #### Due to the way Minecraft handles rendering entities through transparent entities on 1.13-1.14, Tink doesn't show up in her lantern outside Peter Pan when it becomes translucent. The one closer to Fantasyland's entrance seems unaffected by this.

I did not create any of the original textures or models - those were created by the staff at [Imagine Fun](https://imaginefun.net/).

The main lot of conversion from 1.12 over to other versions was done through a [resource pack converter](https://github.com/agentdid127/ResourcePackConverter) made by [@agentdid127](https://github.com/agentdid127).

While I discovered this myself before seeing it, user @Kumki Sakuraüå∏#9388 (on discord) found the issue with certain animated textures not working on versions higher than 1.12.2. I figured it wouldn't be right if I didn't credit them also.
